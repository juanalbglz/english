# Edit for stringy sentences

## STRINGY SENTENCES

Stringy sentences are sentences that are too long. They are too long because they have too many independent clauses joined together with coordinating conjunctions such as _and_, _but_ or _so_.
  

   
  ### Stringy

### Practice
Mark the stringy sentences in the following composition by drawing a line in the right margin. Write STR to the right of the line. The first sentence is marked for you. Then discuss with your class ways to rewrite the stringy sentences correctly.

#### The Worrisome Side Effects of Computers
<sup>1</sup>Computers have several bad side effects that worry me. <sup>2</sup>One negative side effect is that people can get addicted to computers.
<sup>3</sup><span class="str">Their addiction forces them to spend all their free time in front of the computer, so this ovsession damages family life bevause these people no longer spend enoufh time with their loved ones, and people can rely too much on computers to do their work, so when the computer is down dor som ereason, there people become distressed.</span>  

<sup>4</sup>Another bad side effect is that using a computer for many hours can be harmful to a person's health.
<sup>5</sup><span class="str">Back problems and wrist pain are common for people with computer jobvs, and computers can cause eyestrai, which can lead to heaaches, and perople who work with computers for long perios of time can become overweight because from the lack of physical activity, but getting physical therapy can minimize these problems.</span>  

<sup>6</sup>The most worrisome side effects are those associated with children. 
<sup>7</sup>There are parts of the Internet that children should not see. 
<sup>8</sup>Some Internet chat rooms are one example. 
<sup>9</sup><span class="str">Signing on to a chat room can be dangerous for children because they are inexperienced, and adults can esaily trick them, and newspapers have reported several cases of children ving taken advantage of by adults after visiting a chat room.</span> 
<sup>10</sup><span class="str">Another aspect of the Internet that could be harmful for children is adversising or Web sites that advertise adult products or even unsafe items such as power tools.</span>  
<sup>11</sup>Perhaps limits would provide the solution. 
<sup>12</sup>If people could limit thir time on the computer, they might avoid becoming addicted and having other health problems. 
<sup>13</sup>Even more important, if children were not allowed on a computer without their parent's presence, they could be protected from material for adults only.
