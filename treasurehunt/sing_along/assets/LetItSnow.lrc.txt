[00:00.72] Oh, the weather outside is frightful But the fire is so delightful
[00:18.60] And since we've no place to go Let it snow! Let it snow! Let it snow!
[00:26.02] Man it doesn't show signs of stopping And I brought me some corn for popping
[00:34.02] The lights are turned way down low Let it snow! Let it snow!
[00:43.02] When we finally said goodnight How I'll hate going out in the storm
[00:53.60] But if you'll really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm
[00:58.02] And the fire is slowly dying And, my dear, we're still goodbying
[01:08.02] But as long as you'd love me so Let it snow! Let it snow!Let it snow!
[01:15.58] When we finally kiss goodnight How I'll hate going out in the storm
[01:23.01] But if you really hold me tight All the way home I'll be warm
[01:32.01] Oh, the fire is slowly dying And, my dear, we're still goodbying
[01:40.01] But as long as you love me so Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!
